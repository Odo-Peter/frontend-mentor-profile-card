## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge has taught me the importance of a proper markup and the power of CSS, alongside media queries, also, in the cause of the challenge, learning to work with an API again, feels awesome (by API, I meant importing the google fonts from google api and using it in the challenge).

The challenge has also added to my knowledge, in terms of using markdown files and in committing a file to github, basically working with the command line has improved some more, all thanks to frontend mentor's challenge.

Futhermore, I learnt how to set svgs' as background image for the body of the markup and transforming, translating, and rotating it to the desired style.

### Continued development

In future projects or challenges, I'ld love to add a javascript function that changes the svgs' at the background and also, change the profile content, maybe like a search function.

### Useful resources

Ensure to be kind enough to give a little donation to help them to continue giving out value.
